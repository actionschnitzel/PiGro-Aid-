Tasksel:
Install the desktop environment of your choice with all dependencies.
This package provides a simple interface for users who want to configure their 
system to perform a specific task. This program is used during the installation 
process, but users can also use tasksel at any time.

Change Desktop environment:
Switch to a specific desktop after the reboot.
A desktop environment bundles together a variety of components to provide common 
graphical user interface elements such as icons, toolbars, wallpapers, and desktop 
widgets. Additionally, most desktop environments include a set of integrated 
applications and utilities. Most importantly, desktop environments provide their 
own window manager, which can however usually be replaced with another compatible one.

Change WM:
Executes "sudo update-alternatives --config x-window-manager"
This uses Debian's built-in mechanisms to choose "alternatives" for default commands.

A window manager (WM) is system software that controls the placement and appearance 
of windows within a windowing system in a graphical user interface (GUI). 
It can be part of a desktop environment (DE) or be used standalone.

Window managers are unique to Xorg. The equivalent of window managers on Wayland 
are called compositors because they also act as compositing window managers.
