May-ntenance! loooool xD

Hahah hahah ... I'm so funny .... not...!

It turned out that Ubuntu 22.04 is kind of stable xD
Yes I'm shocked too! I made PiGro Ubuntu compateple!
But that means not Ubuntu Mate! And never ever ask for an Arch version.
Not gonna happen bro!

So this deserves a new code name! "PiGro - Stupida Medusa!"

#IMPORTANT: For some reason you must click on Reset Overclocking twice to
unlock the tuning berries. I could not find the causing line but I'm on it.
1st BUG xD ... Yeah!


#ADDED I added a Pi Camera Tab just for fun. Never saw an App
        that does Pi Cam stuff in a GUI ...
        So maybe it stay in PiGro maby not... time will tell.

#ADDED Rename user option for old pi installations

#ADDED Expert Mode for Tuning

#ADDED Cute Tux greets you with your user name

#CHANGED User Pi said goodbye! PiGro now full supports user names 

#CHANGED Rearranged Software tab 

#FIXED If Snap/Pi-Apps/Flatpak is not installed the buttons
        are disabled

#FIXED As always there are code improvements


#APT-GET Installer shows now terminal output due to transperency reasons 

#CODE CHANGES:

PiGro now uses even more of Python's "OS Modules" to collect system information. 
Not for spying, but for the reason I decided to squeeze the Ubuntu version 
between the Pi OS code. Ubuntu really doesn't have much in common with Debian. 

Long story short: 

It's a huge pile of "if, else, then, f-string" stuff.




Best regards

Timo
