arm_freq:
Frequency of the ARM CPU in MHz.

arm_boost:
Increases arm_freq to the highest supported frequency for the board-type 
and firmware. Set to 1 to enable.

gpu_freq:
Sets core_freq, h264_freq, isp_freq, v3d_freq and hevc_freq together

over_voltage:
CPU/GPU core upper voltage limit. 
The value should be in the range [-16,8] 
which equates to the range [0.95V,1.55V] ([0.8,1.4V] on RPi 1) 
with 0.025V steps. In other words, specifying -16 will give 0.95V 
(0.8V on RPi 1) as the maximum CPU/GPU core voltage, 
and specifying 8 will allow up to 1.55V (1.4V on RPi 1). 
For defaults see table below. 
Values above 6 are only allowed when force_turbo=1 is specified: 
this sets the warranty bit if over_voltage_* > 0 is also set.

force_turbo:
By default (force_turbo=0) the "On Demand" CPU frequency 
driver will raise clocks to their maximum frequencies when the 
ARM cores are busy and will lower them to the minimum 
frequencies when the ARM cores are idle.
force_turbo=1 overrides this behaviour and forces maximum 
frequencies even when the ARM cores are not busy.
Forces turbo mode frequencies even when the ARM cores are 
not busy. 
Enabling this may set the warranty bit if over_voltage_* is also set.

gpu_mem_256:
The gpu_mem_256 command sets the GPU memory in megabytes 
for Raspberry Pis with 256MB of memory. 
(It is ignored if memory size is not 256MB). 
This overrides gpu_mem.

gpu_mem_512:
The gpu_mem_512 command sets the GPU memory in megabytes 
for Raspberry Pis with 512MB of memory. 
(It is ignored if memory size is not 512MB). 
This overrides gpu_mem.

gpu_mem_1024:
The gpu_mem_1024 command sets the GPU memory in megabytes 
for Raspberry Pis with 1GB or more of memory. 
(It is ignored if memory size is smaller than 1GB). 
This overrides gpu_mem.

Zram: This creates a compressing block device right in the computer's memory. 
However, zRam is only used when the main memory is full: 
the kernel first uses the entire available RAM, 
then it tries to compress parts of it into zRam. 
In this way, more data can be kept in memory. 
In practice, this means that the system does not have to move to a slower 
hard drive so quickly, 
but the price is a slightly higher processor load.
