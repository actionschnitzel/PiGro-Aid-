Shop:
If you click on Shop PDL will open. This is a GUI for APT that I developed myself. 
Why? Because I wanted to try. That's why! 
Here you will also find drivers for popular Raspberry Pi hardware.

Fast Installer:
If you know the exact package name you can enter it here and install it. 
Without sudo apt-get install.
This also works with Snap Pi apps and Flatpak.

To use snap and flatpaks you have to install them at first ;-)

Snap:
sudo apt install snapd


Flatpak:
sudo apt install flatpak 
flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo
