Raspi-Config GUI:
Window based version of raspi-config.


Config.txt:
The Raspberry Pi uses a configuration file instead of the BIOS 
you would expect to find on a conventional PC. 
The system configuration parameters, which would traditionally 
be edited and stored using a BIOS, 
are stored instead in an optional text file named config.txt.
