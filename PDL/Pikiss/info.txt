Installing an application on Linux is not a complex task.\nSometimes you just type sudo apt install and get\n the application installed with all of its dependencies.\nBut... What if we need to install more than one app\n such as a web server or it requires many steps to complete\nthe install process? Is it not in the\n official repositories? What if you want to get rid of input commands?
