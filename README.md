#### PiGro - Just Click It! is a control panel that bundles the most important options.

Due to the reduced desktop, Raspberry Pi OS lacks a control center that makes all options accessible at a glance. I started using opensuse when I was young and still do. I love the possibilities of its control center YaST.

And that's exactly what PiGro is, a tool inspired by the possibilities of YaST.

With a clear and graphically appealing GUI you can access the system deeply, overclock the Pi or replace the entire desktop environment. Everything you need to use the Pi as a desktop computer.

PiGro does many commands that have to be entered via the terminal with one or two clicks of a button.

##### :wrench: Sudo apt-get update/upgrade
##### :wrench: Sudo apt-get install ...
##### :wrench: Sudo nano boot / config.txt
##### :wrench: Overclocking
##### :wrench: Install and change the DE
##### :wrench: Add Autostart on DE Login
### And there is a lot more!

### :two_hearts: You want support me?

PiGro is completely free. I put up to three hours into improvements and updates every day. Not to forget the countless hours I spend reading manuals and reference books. If you like my work, you can support me. The easiest way is to buy a sticker or something from RedBubble so you get something and so do I ;-)

# :exclamation: Important

#### Pigro will install xterm. For some reason, Xterm is then selected as default terminal emulator. You can change that by:
     
Open the Terminal and type `sudo update-alternatives --config x-terminal-emulator`. All available terminal emulators are listed. `lxterminal` is the default.
