# PiGro+Aid+

I love making cool things out of the pi. I mainly use Raspbian / Raspberry Pi OS. But if you set up new systems as often as I do or try them out a lot, you have to make the same configurations over and over again. I programmed a GUI that executes everyday terminal commands at the push of a button. Nothing big.
