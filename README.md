## All settings in one place! :key: :mag: :hammer: :toilet:

#### PiGro - Just Click It! is a control panel that bundles the most important options.

Due to the reduced desktop, Raspberry Pi OS lacks a control center that makes all options accessible at a glance. I started working with opensuse when I was young and still do. I love the possibilities of its control center YaSt.

And that's exactly what PiGro is, a tool inspired by the possibilities of YasT.

With a clear and graphically appealing GUI you can access the system deeply, overclock the Pi or replace the entire desktop environment. Everything you need to use the Pi as a desktop computer.

PiGro does many commands that have to be entered via the terminal with one or two clicks of a button.

##### :wrench: Sudo apt-get update/upgrade

##### :wrench: Sudo apt-get install ...

##### :wrench: Sudo nano boot / config.txt

##### :wrench: Overclocking

##### :wrench: Install and change the DE

### And there is a lot more!


With the latest release (codename: Stupida Medusa) PiGro - Just Click It! also works on Ubuntu.

### Tested and working on:
- [X] Raspberry Pi OS Bullseye with PIXEL(No desktop notification support,due to reduced desktop)    
- [X] Raspberry Pi OS Buster with PIXEL (No desktop notification support,due to reduced desktop)    
- [X] Raspberry Pi OS Bullseye with XFCE (FULL Support, no problems)
- [X] Raspberry Pi OS Buster with XFCE (FULL Support, no problems)
- [X] Twister OS (FULL Support)
- [x] Ubuntu 22.04 (FULL Support with some Wayland caused work arounds)    
            - needs RPI.GPIO & gpiozero from pip(not preinstalled)    
                will be added to install script
- [ ] Diet Pi with XFCE (Testing in progress)    
    
#### The "No desktop notification support" Info is not a Problem thats affects PiGro's functionality

#### Can you trust me?

Yup! It's open source, after all.
Nevertheless you should know what you are doing because most of it works with "SUDO" in PiGro.
