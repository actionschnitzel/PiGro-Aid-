# :exclamation: Important

#### `Pigro will install xterm`. For some reason, Xterm is then selected as default terminal emulator. You can change that by:

Open the Terminal and type `sudo update-alternatives --config x-terminal-emulator`. All available terminal emulators are listed. `lxterminal` is the default.

#### `Diet-Pi`: PiGro wouln't start because Wifi adapter is not set up:

`dietpi-config` > 7:Network Adapters > Wifi (This enables Wifi adapter)
