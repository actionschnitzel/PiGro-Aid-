PiGro does many commands that have to be entered via the terminal with one or two clicks of a button.

PiGro â€“ Just Click It! Is based on Python's Tkinter module. Due to its greatly reduced LXDE/PIXEL desktop, Raspberry Pi OS lacks some setting options. Pigro centralizes all important settings for the Raspberry Pi desktop and adds a GUI for overclocking to the desktop.

# :dart: Next Update / To-Do

#### Roadmap for Version 9:
    
#### Playing around with colors and backgrounds was cool and stuff but after almost three years I want PiGro to feel more like an OS built-in tool. But the base remains as it is. I love YaST and the Cinnamon desktop. It's finally time to bring both together in PiGro.

#### Pigro will install xterm. For some reason, Xterm is then selected as default terminal emulator. You can change that by:
     
Open the Terminal and type `sudo update-alternatives --config x-terminal-emulator`. All available terminal emulators are listed. `lxterminal` is the default.

### :two_hearts: You want support me?

PiGro is completely free. I put up to three hours into improvements and updates every day. Not to forget the countless hours I spend reading manuals and reference books. If you like my work, you can support me. The easiest way is to buy a sticker or something from RedBubble so you get something and so do I ;-)
