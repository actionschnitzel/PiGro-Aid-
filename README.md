## All settings in one place! :key: :mag: :hammer: :toilet:

#### PiGro - Just Click It! is a control panel that bundles the most important options.

The most important settings that are used again and again must be entered on the Pi using a terminal.
Pigro is a graphically appealing GUI that does these settings with the click of a button.
My first Ĺinux distro was Suse Linux 9.0 and I loved YaST.So the guiding principle for me is that PiGro goes very much in the direction of YaSt.

##### :wrench: Sudo apt-get update/upgrade

##### :wrench: Sudo apt-get install ...

##### :wrench: Sudo nano boot / config.txt

##### :wrench: Overclocking

##### :wrench: Install and change the DE

### And there is a lot more!

#### Can you trust me?

Yup! It's open source, after all.
Nevertheless you should know what you are doing because most of it works with "SUDO" in PiGro.

# :wrench: Info  
    
PiGro is only compatible with operating systems based on Raspberry Pi OS. I have tried several times to program an Ubuntu version. Unfortunately, it turns out again and again that Ubuntu is unstable and bugged for the Pi. Should there ever be an Ubuntu-Pi version that is STABLE from installation and runs smoothly, I will get to work.
