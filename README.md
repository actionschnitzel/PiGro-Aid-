## All settings in one place! :key: :mag: :hammer: :toilet:

#### PiGro - Just Click It! is a control panel that bundles the most important options.

Due to the reduced desktop, Raspberry Pi OS lacks a control center that makes all options accessible at a glance. I started using opensuse when I was young and still do. I love the possibilities of its control center YaST.

And that's exactly what PiGro is, a tool inspired by the possibilities of YaST.

With a clear and graphically appealing GUI you can access the system deeply, overclock the Pi or replace the entire desktop environment. Everything you need to use the Pi as a desktop computer.

PiGro does many commands that have to be entered via the terminal with one or two clicks of a button.

##### :wrench: Sudo apt-get update/upgrade

##### :wrench: Sudo apt-get install ...

##### :wrench: Sudo nano boot / config.txt

##### :wrench: Overclocking

##### :wrench: Install and change the DE

### And there is a lot more!

With the latest release (codename: Stupida Medusa) PiGro - Just Click It! also works on Ubuntu.

# :exclamation: Important
    
#### Pigro will install xterm. For some reason, Xterm is then selected as default terminal emulator. You can change that by:
     
Open the File Manager (`pcmanfm`) > `Edit` >`Preferences` > `Advanced`. Then set the `Terminal Emulator` to `lxterminal %s` or the Terminal Emulater of your choice
