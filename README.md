# :tada: PiGro Xtrmo - Just Click It
![GUI](https://github.com/actionschnitzel/tingsandstuff/blob/main/header%20X.png)

All settings in one place!    
    
Raspberry Pi OS based distros awesome. What I missed from the start is a central control panel. Many settings are hidden or have to be made manually using the terminal. PiGro is inspired by the control interface of Linux Mint and MX Linux.    
    
The most important settings that are used again and again must be entered on the Pi using a terminal. Pigro is a graphically appealing GUI that does these settings with the click of a button.     
    
Sudo apt-get update/upgrade? .... No, just click it!     
Sudo apt-get install ...? No, just click it!     
Sudo nano boot / config.txt? No, just click it!     
    
And there is a lot more!    
   
You want support me?
