# PiGro Xtrmo - Just Click It
![GUI](https://github.com/actionschnitzel/tingsandstuff/blob/main/header%20X.png)

I love making cool things out of the pi. I mainly use Raspberry Pi OS and Twister OS. But if you set up new systems as often as I do or try them out a lot, you have to make the same configurations over and over again. I programmed a GUI that executes everyday terminal commands at the push of a button. Nothing big.    

Originally I wanted to bring out an update every few months. But since I have many ideas and also take maintenance very seriously, you should do a "git pull" regularly. The next project will be an "Auto-Update"
    
go full lazy with PiGro OS:

###Install

```
git clone https://github.com/actionschnitzel/PiGro-Aid-.git
cd PiGro-Aid-
sudo chmod +x install.sh
sudo ./install.sh
```    
after "git pull" you shoud do "./install.sh"
