#### All settings in one place! :key: :mag: :hammer: :toilet:   
    
#### Raspberry Pi OS based distros awesome. What I missed from the start is a central control panel. Many settings are hidden or have to be made manually using the terminal. My first Ĺinux distro was Suse Linux 9.0 and I loved YaST.So the guiding principle for me is that PiGro goes very much in the direction of YaSt.     
    
#### The most important settings that are used again and again must be entered on the Pi using a terminal. Pigro is a graphically appealing GUI that does these settings with the click of a button.     
    
Sudo apt-get update/upgrade? .... No, just click it!     
Sudo apt-get install ...? No, just click it!     
Sudo nano boot / config.txt? No, just click it!     
    
#### And there is a lot more! 


#### Pigro includes options for both the Pixel Desktop and XFCE4. I am a big fan of XFCE and TwisterOS which is why the focus is often on these two. But everything works just as well under RaspiOS. ... Except for the transparency :-(. I always try to stay up to date and add the latest features or cool things from youtube.

#### Can you trust me?
#### Yup! It's open source, after all.
#### Nevertheless you should know what you are doing because most of it works with "SUDO" in PiGro.
