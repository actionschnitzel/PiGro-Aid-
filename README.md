PiGro does many commands that have to be entered via the terminal with one or two clicks of a button.

PiGro â€“ Just Click It! Is based on Python's Tkinter module. Due to its greatly reduced LXDE/PIXEL desktop, Raspberry Pi OS lacks some setting options. Pigro centralizes all important settings for the Raspberry Pi desktop and adds a GUI for overclocking to the desktop.

# :exclamation: Important

#### Pigro will install xterm. For some reason, Xterm is then selected as default terminal emulator. You can change that by:

Open the Terminal and type `sudo update-alternatives --config x-terminal-emulator`. All available terminal emulators are listed. `lxterminal` is the default.

#### By default "Authentication Mode" is set to pkexec (Only Raspberry Pi OS allows Passwordless-SUDO).

If you like to switch to `Passwordless` go to `Look & Feel` and under `PiGro Tweaks` you cann select `Passwordless-SUDO` or `pkexec`.
