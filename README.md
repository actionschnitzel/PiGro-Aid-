# PiGro+Aid+

I love making cool things out of the pi. I mainly use Raspbian / RaspberryOS. But if you set up new systems as often as I do or try them out a lot, you have to make the same configurations over and over again. Because I was bored, I programmed a GUI that executes everyday terminal commands at the push of a button. Nothing big.

Excuse my English
I'm not a native speeker

Tested it.... You will not break the system ;-)

git clone https://github.com/actionschnitzel/PiGro-Aid-.git
    • cd PiGro-Aid-
    • sudo chmod +x install.sh
    • sudo ./install.sh
